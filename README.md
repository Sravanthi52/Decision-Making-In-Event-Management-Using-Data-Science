Organizations trying to generate money encounter a number of challenges as well as several techniques for getting money. Special events can help organizations find funding and further their core objectives. Special event offers a nonprofit organization significant community recognition by utilizing a captive audience of potential donors who are involved in the arts. 

Statistical methods and machine learning algorithms were used to analyze the impact of parameters like date, time and place on the attendance for an event and draw meaningful information which helped estimate the success of a particular event, as well as improve decision-making when it comes to organizing an event. KNN (k-nearest neighbors), MLP (multi-layer perceptron), and Decision Tree classification models were fitted for this dataset and their respective accuracies, ROC curves, and AUCs were compared to finalize a predictive model with customized parameters.
